Various tools to help with your Magicami needs. Includes a skill and Dress database, complete with
ways to filter and sort through them.

Available for Android, go the releases tab and download the APK to use. The app is made in Flutter,
so an IOS version is possible. But I have no devices to publish to the App Store. Someone feel free to fork
and try to publish it for IOS/Play store. Ditto for a potential web version: I don't know how to get a
server rolling and there probably needs to be some UI adjustments for a webpage afterwards.

Any and all help welcome. Ideally someone with more time than me forks and publishes this, but I wanted
to get the ball rolling.

### Short term goals

- allow loading custom DB's from a file (android only).
- add a "best dubdress" tab to Dress Details page: allowing you to see which subdresses contribute
the most stats to a particular main dress
- Damage calculator
- Simple Orb Rater

### Future niceties (probably not by me)

- overhaul the CSV "database" to fetch from an updating web server. Will also help cut the app size down by a LOT
- Dress/team builder
- color theming?

The data is updated based on [these sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkroakfeauzCiTS8rNJxwVCD-a9rb1h_hhOh8Gx20OE/edit#gid=1968620388).
I may not have time to update them on a timely basis so feel free to reach out if you want to maintain it with future skill mods and dresses. At the moment,
the sheets are updated through to the Goddess of Destiny, so it is updated to about 10/2020 in Japan's dresses.

for research in the skill powers.
